## Step 4: Open the VB6 Source file ##
After the file is downloaded to your local Downloads directory, you must open the received ZIP file. Depending on the browser being used, this may be possible via a pop-up window.

If your application folder was called "MyApplication", the file explorer shows the following files.

<br/><br/>

## Step 6: Open XpressNet.vbp ##
Open the file named XpressNet.vbp, which is the Visual Basic 6 project group that holds together the various XpressNet source files.

<br/><br/>

## Step 7: Add project ##
To use the XpressNet sources in your own application program, you have to open a second project (add project) that will later contain the code for your own program. In general your own application program will take the form of a standard EXE.

<br/><br/>

## Step 8: Second project group ##
The second project has now been created. Put the code for your own application in this new project, and give it a meaningful name. Gave also the project group a meaningful name and save it
